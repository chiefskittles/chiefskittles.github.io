	Another stream-focused pack, and another pack dedicated to a single artist (if the title didn't tip you off).
	This pack was initially started to be part of a series of packs headed by Okami named "Stamina Factory," with
	each entry in the series being dedicated to a different artist, crafted by a different step artist. Unfortunately,
	the series was ultimately unable to take flight, but by that time, the majority of this pack had already been written,
	so I finished it up regardless.
	<br><br>
	And then I restepped it, because most of it was... really bad.
	<br><br>
	And then I restepped it again, because it was still bad.
	<br><br>
	So, in the end, this one took a lot of effort to get just right, and in spending said effort, I ended up learning
	a ton about how to pattern streams well at all speeds (coupled with the one-offs and singles I was doing on the 
	side for the fof crowd) and formed a rough, but lovingly-crafted foundation for me to become adept at charting
	not just tech, but stream files as well.
	<br><br>
	The ultimate capstone to this pack is "Promised Everland," an original, 20-minute long mixtape created by the master
	himself, Rems. This marathon serves as the "boss" of the pack and is, naturally, significantly more challenging 
	to play and pass than the other charts present. I strongly encourage you to listen to the mix even if you're 
	not interested in playing the chart - it is absolutely phenomenal.

	The first fully-stream pack I wrote, finished and released. This (mini)pack is a six-song bundle of the
	album "Resistance Device" by Matatabi Sound System, one of Kobaryo's many aliases, focusing on a 
	Frenchcore-style sound, with some influences from his other styles/aliases as well.

  <h3 class="header">"Possibly the best tech pack of 2019" - Released Apr. 2019</h3>
  <p>

	</a>
	<p>
	Yes, someone said that about this pack. No, I didn't pay them to say it. This pack contains some of my best work 
	thus far and marks the point where I feel like I really locked in my own personal style of technical writing. 
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
	Highlights and notable tournament files include Arcology on Permafrost, Bubble in the Air, Estrangement, Giga Thrash, 
	Glitched Character, Panjandrum, Quality Control, Samplinglitch, and Zephyr.
	</p>
	<br><br>
	<p>
	Yes, that is almost half the pack. I wasn't kidding when I said this is some of my best work.

  <h3 class="header">Collab Pack with Sudzi781 - Released Mar. 2019</h3>

	  A collab born of our mutual love of heavy metal music, this pack was intentionally designed to 
	  be lighter on the tech than the writing meta of the time. While there are only Expert charts present here, this pack
	  is significantly more relaxed in both design and execution than some of my other efforts around this time; it's 
	  simply fun charts to good music.
	  <br><br>
	  Highlights (of mine) include Cinnamon and LIGHTNING.

  <h3 class="header">We ECFA now - Released Jan. 2019</h3>

	  <p>
	  Finally, competence emerges. This pack is when I began specifically leaning towards "tournament-style" writing in my 
	  simfiles. Consequently, this is when some of my files began to make infrequent appearances in tournament packs,
	  such as Rumble in the Prairie, DDR Storm, and East Coast FA. This pack was also when I first attempted to explore the
	  idea of a supplementary scale to better quantify a chart's "scoring" difficulty separate from its passing difficulty
	  (something that several people began to develop around this time) and the """humble""" beginnings of my tendency
	  to write comically-long readmes for all of my packs.
	  <br><br>
	  As you might imagine from the description, the majority of the files in this pack range from moderately to exceptionally 
	  technical, with few stream or "basic" files present.
	  <br><br>
	  Highlights include Dual Emotion, Flashdance, Lonely Witch, Travel to Future, and Zombie Stomp.

	    <p>
		The first time I ever collaborated with another step artist, and the first time I ever wrote files specifically
		to be challenging or unusual tech. Arguably the pack that first made me relevant in the charting metagame as a
		whole. I'm forever gracious to ATB for being open to working with a relative newbie to make something special
		in the technical simfile universe come to life.
		<br><br>
		Highlights (of mine) include ChaserXX, Contrast, Hellcrime, and Mischievous Masquerade

	    <p>
	    The first pack I created that I considered to have competent (at minimal) charting and writing from top to bottom.
	    While there are few truly standout files, everything here is at least enjoyable and crafted decently-well, in my opinion.
	    <br><br>
	    Highlights include ErrorCode and Grand Slam.

	  <p>
	  These are all my old files. The vast majority of them are utter trash. I advise you to avoid them entirely.
	  </p>
	  <br>
	  <p>
	  Prior to now, I was adamant that these no longer be distributed for a large number of reasons, the most obvious
	  of which is that they all suck. Enormously. However, enough people have asked me about seeing these that I have
	  decided to acquiese and allow them to be downloaded once again.
	  </p>
	  <br>
	  <p style="font-weight: bold">
	  IMPORTANT NOTE - I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH
	  </p>
	  <br>
	  <p>
	  These files were all made far, far before I really got a good grip on proper charting. As such, I cannot guarantee that
	  any of these files are synced well, flow properly, or are even fun. Again, I REALLY encourage you to play my newer files
	  instead. I do not have the time nor the desire to return to any of these and improve any facet of them at all.
