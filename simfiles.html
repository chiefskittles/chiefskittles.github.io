	  These are all my old files. The vast majority of them are utter trash. I advise you to avoid them entirely.
	  </p>
	  <br>
	  <p>
	  Prior to now, I was adamant that these no longer be distributed for a large number of reasons, the most obvious
	  of which is that they all suck. Enormously. However, enough people have asked me about seeing these that I have
	  decided to acquiese and all them to be downloaded once again.

	  IMPORTANT NOTE - I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH
	  </p>
	  <br>
	  <p>
	  These files were all made far, far before I really got a good grip on proper charting. As such, I cannot guarantee that
	  any of these files are synced well, flow properly, or are even fun. Again, I REALLY encourage you to play my newer files
	  instead. I do not have the time nor the desire to return to any of these and improve any facet of them at all.
